Step 1: Define the Layout Structure
Header Section:

Add a navigation bar with menu items like About Us, Events, Sponsors, Contact Us.
Include the logo on the left side.
Hero Section:

Place a large globe logo in the center.
Design the particle-splitting animation to draw attention (use Figma plugins like ProtoPie or After Effects for prototype animation).
Content Sections:

About Us: Highlight the purpose and goals of the tech fest.
Events: Separate blocks for categories such as Robotics, Cultural Events, etc.
Sponsors: List the sponsors with their logos and descriptions.
Location and Contact: Map widget, college address, and contact details.
Footer:

Include quick links like View Brochure, ASTU, and Dhemaji Engineering College Website.
Social media icons and copyright details.
Step 2: Create the Design in Figma
Open a New Figma File:

Set the canvas size to match your website's target screen resolution (e.g., 1440px width).
Design the Globe Logo Section:

Import or design a globe logo.
Use the Figma prototyping tool or external tools to simulate particles splitting and moving outward.
Add Header and Navigation:

Use rectangles for menu items and align them with a grid.
Insert your logo on the top-left corner.
Hero Section:

Place the globe in the center.
Add text overlays, such as “Get Ready for the First-Ever Tech Event of Dhemaji Engineering College.”
About Us Section:

Use grids for text alignment.
Add an image or illustration to complement the content.
Event Categories Section:

Create cards for each event (Robotics, Cultural Events, etc.).
Use icons or related images for better visualization.
Sponsors Section:

Design a grid layout to display logos of sponsors.
Include descriptive text under each sponsor.
Footer:

Create a row for quick links and contact details.
Add buttons for external links.
Step 3: Add Animations and Interactions
Use Prototyping Mode in Figma for interactions like:
Hover effects on menu items.
Smooth scrolling between sections.
Particle movement for the globe logo (additional tool required for advanced animation).
Step 4: Preview and Export
Prototype:

Test the design for usability.
Check the flow between sections.
Export Assets:

Export images, icons, and other visuals for development.
